5)	Government Budgeting
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Indicators
http://bit.ly/PEFAassessment
Under the Public Expenditure and Accountability (PEFA) Program, the public financial management (PFM) Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) (or PEFA Framework) has been developed as a contribution to the collective efforts of many stakeholders to assess whether a country has the tools to deliver three main budgetary outcomes:
•	Aggregate fiscal discipline
•	Strategic resource allocation
•	Efficient use of resources for service delivery
Includes indicators on open budget process and budget review that can be adapted to all types of laws

Open Budget Survey
http://bit.ly/OpenBudgetSurvey
The Open Budget Survey Tracker (OBS Tracker) allows citizens, civil society, media, and others to monitor in real time whether central governments are releasing the requisite information on how the government is managing public finances.
•	Budget transparency – the amount, level of detail, and timeliness of budget information governments are making publically available. Each country is given a score between 0 and 100 that determines its ranking on the Open Budget Index.
•	Budget participation – the opportunities governments are providing to civil society and the general public to engage in decisions about how public resources are raised and spent.
•	Budget oversight – the capacity and authority of formal institutions (such as legislatures and supreme audit institutions) to understand and influence how public resources are being raised and spent.

7)	Government Service Delivery 

Example from South Africa - http://bit.ly/GovServiceDeliverySurvey  (see caution below)

Methodology: The study applied a purposive sampling procedure in selecting the Departments that participated in the survey and their selected service delivery sites. During the sampling of the service delivery sites of the Departments, attention was also given to both the urban and rural service sites. 

Based on 12 “drivers” of citizen satisfaction:  Accessibility to public services, treating the citizens with Courtesy and consideration, Timeliness in the provision of services, availability of Information on public services, the Knowledge and Competence of officials, the condition of the Facilities in which services are delivered, Fairness and Equity in service delivery, Value for Money in Public Service delivery, providing Redress where a promised standard of service has not been met and Outcome of the encounter with the Public Service.

Objective indicators of quality 
	Quality : (a) coverage area; (b) types of support available from ancillary facilities; (c) quality of services (human resources and medical supplies);  (d) infrastructure; (e) time till service; (f) accuracy of service.

Subjective instruments that gauge citizen perceptions - citizen report cards, community scorecards, facility exit polls, and citizen satisfaction surveys

Satisfaction surveys are appealing
	A quick and easy way for policymakers to measure thocie impact of governance reforms on government performance, particularly for sectors where measurement of service quality is not easy, provided citizen satisfaction is closely correlated with the actual quality of services. 
	Less time and labor intensive than facility surveys and public expenditure tracking surveys)

CAUTION: There is little consensus on whether citizens’ satisfaction surveys reflects the actual quality of services.  Try to use Objective Indicators in combination with Satisfaction Surveys.
